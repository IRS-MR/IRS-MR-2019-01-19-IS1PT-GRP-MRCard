With the limited time, our project scope was diminished to a minimum viable product (MVP) level, which is version 1.0. Here is the full scope for the commercial version:

\begin{description}[align=left]
	\item [version 1.1] Include Deposit Account

		As most banks have special deposit account interest calculation and it could differ a lot.

		With deposit account, a better recommendation could be provided based on the user's deposit and salary. This could include what deposit account should be opened to get highest interest by credit salary, save, insure or invest.


	\item [version 1.2] Credit Card Combination

		From the survey result, we noticed most people had more than one credit cards. More values may be created if the user can get a recommendation with a combination of credit cards. Our system could be improved to a better result with the credit card combination.

	\item [version 1.3] Credit Card Data

		We chose to use the long term feature of credit cards but many attractive promotion were made by banks. To get better result, an advanced method should be used to scrape the data. Add more data fields like expiring date for promotions should be included for a better recommendation.

	% \item [version 0.5] Fuzzy Logic Improvement

	% 	For miles cards and rewards cards, the current version 0.1 only includes a basic fuzzy logic is used to estimate the cash value of miles and rewards points. To get a better result, detailed data on miles and rewards points conversion are required to match a better cash value.
