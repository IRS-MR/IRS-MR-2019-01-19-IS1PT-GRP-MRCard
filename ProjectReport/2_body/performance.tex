We performed validation on 3 different scenarios (shown in Appendix A) to ensure that our recommendation system provides the correct expected output. Scenario 1 was to test for a typical father's spending habits. Scenario 2 was to test from the perspective of a DBS staff that is interested in the best Credit Card for a certain group of individuals, and to compare that with DBS Credit Cards. Scenario 3 was on the extreme case where the user is not eligible for any Credit Cards. For more information please check out Appendix A.
